    "The Solve4X dataset provides data on 6 processes, which are divided into a total of 36 scenes. Analyze the processes \"New asset inventory\", \"Asset disbursement to clients\" and \"Self-service asset check-out\" across all scenes. Follow the key questions below, but feel free to add your own analysis. The most important thing is that you can present a comprehensive picture of the processes.\n",
