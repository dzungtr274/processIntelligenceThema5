    "1.  Automatic asset tracking & logging:\n",
    "    New asset inventory & Asset disbursement to client.\n",
    "    The processes include manual dependencies on initial logging and quality checks of the assets, acceptance or rejections by the IT staff. Which can lead to potential errors or delays. Like mismatch between physical and digital records.The above can be prevented by use of:\\\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. IoT based RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Tags:\n",
    "    These can ensure automated asset logging as well as movement tracking.\n",
    "    These tags attached to assets would allow real-time tracking and auto updates in the ITAM system. Similar to Library systems, RFID tags, readers and receivers at checkouts (e.g., storage rooms, check-out counters) facilitate self-checkout or alarm un checked out assets. Such a system and research already exit, to reduces manual logging errors and provides real-time asset visibility.\n",

    "    b. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Technology\n",
    "    UWB devices to enhance indoor location tracking. To track personnel and asset movement, Log proximity events, such as when an asset is near a check-out counter.\\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Enhance Video Analysis with AI.\n",
    "    Due to the possible blind spots in transition points like retrieving items from warehouse or handing them over to the client, minimal tracking during the physical retrieval of assets from the self-service area may lack sufficient real-time tracking, leading to potential misplacements or delays and even potential risks, such as unregistered pick-ups or unauthorized access to items.\n",
    "    Also gaps in tracking transitions between the receiving zone & storage.\n",
    "    A computer vision system with advanced cameras to read and recognize asset tags or asset handling movements and automatically logging them in the system. Video data could be processed with AI-powered analytics to detect specific events (e.g., asset removal, check-out interactions).\\\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Barcode/QR codes on asset tags.\n",
    "    To simply improve efficiency and eliminate manual data entry errors, code scanners can be deployed to be used by both IT staff and employees to check in and out of assets at all critical points.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Client Identification at the self-service point:\n",
    "    absence of mechanisms to verify client identity at the point of collection may lead to fraudulent transactions. Enhancing transparency with the combination of an automated identity verification and IoT-enabled RFID tags can be used to address these gaps and ensure robust monitoring throughout the process\n"
