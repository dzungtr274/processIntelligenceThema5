To further improve transparency in the processes of "New asset inventory," "Asset disbursement to clients," and "Self-service asset check-out," several additions could be made to the current processes:

1. Automatic asset tracking & logging:
    a. IoT based RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Tags:
        These tags attached to assets would allow real-time tracking and auto updates in the ITAM system. Similar to Library systems, RFID tags, readers and receivers at checkouts (e.g., storage rooms, check-out counters) facilitate self-checkout or alarm un checked out assets. Such a system and research already exit, to reduces manual logging errors and provides real-time asset visibility.

    b. Bluetooth or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Technology
        Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons or UWB devices can enhance indoor location tracking.
        Implementation:
        Place beacons across the facility to track personnel and asset movement.
        Log proximity events, such as when an asset is near a check-out counter.
        Benefit: Provides granular insights into asset and personnel interactions.
        
2. Enhance Video Analysis with AI.
    A computer vision system with advanced cameras to read and recognize asset tags or handling movements for auto logging in the system. Video data could be processed with AI-powered analytics to detect specific events (e.g., asset removal, check-out interactions).
    
3. Barcode/QR codes on asset tags. These can be easily used by both IT staff and employees to checkout and track assets especially at self-service point.
